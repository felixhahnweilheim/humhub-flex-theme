## Features

### Colors (under development)

**Define your custom colors!**  
You can configure nearly all colors (main colors, text colors, background colors).  
Please note: This still needs more testing and some colors that are hard-coded in HumHub can't be changed.

### Social Controls

**Comment Link**

Choose between the text "Comment" / "Reply" (default) and the comment icon or both.

**Like Link**

Similar to Comment Link. But for the icon you can choose your own from the list of FontAwesome icons.

### Topic menu in spaces and profiles

A topic list can be shown in the left sidebar of spaces and user profiles. (This can be turned of in the module settings.)
