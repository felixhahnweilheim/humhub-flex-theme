**Define your custom colors!**  
Currently the 7 main colors are configurable. But I am planning to make nearly all color variables configurable.

### Social Controls

Choose between the text "Comment" / "Reply" (default) and the comment icon or both.

Similar to Comment Link. But for the icon you can decide between thumbs up (default), heart and star.
