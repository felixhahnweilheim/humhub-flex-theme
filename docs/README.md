## Features

### Colors

**Define your custom colors!**  
You can configure nearly all colors (main colors, text colors, background colors).  
Please note: This still needs more testing and some colors that are hard-coded in HumHub can't be changed.

[Details for Developpers](https://github.com/felixhahnweilheim/humhub-flex-theme/blob/main/themes/FlexTheme/less/README.md)

### Dark Mode (experimental)
The dark mode is disabled by default because it is still experimental.
You should define all colors for it to work properly. There is no dark mode button because the theme uses your browser's dark mode.

### Social Controls

**Comment Link**

Choose between the text "Comment" / "Reply" (default) and the comment icon or both.

**Like Link**

Similar to Comment Link. But for the icon you can choose your own from the list of FontAwesome icons.

### Topic menu in spaces and profiles

A topic list can be shown in the left sidebar of spaces and user profiles. (This can be turned of in the module settings.)

### Import / Export

The module settings can be exported and imported in JSON format.

## Translations

This module is fully translatable. But as long as adminstrators understand English, the translations don't seem too important to me.
